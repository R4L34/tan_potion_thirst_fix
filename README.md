*Tan Potion Thirst Fix

Tough As Nails addon that allows you to choose what potions will give the thirst effect to you.
I always thought that adding thirst to the potions is kinda dumb. Like, you brew them, ON FIRE, and it still gives the effect. And there is no way to override this kind of behaviour since it's hardcoded unlike the other Items.
So I took it upon myself to "dehardcode" it and provide a config file so you could set up your own thing.
By default it only applies a potion effect to water (yeah in Minecraft water bottle and the potions are technically the same item separated by NBT).
